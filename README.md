# Relaxer

Relaxer is a simple web application that provides users with breathing exercises to help them relax and destress. The app uses the 4-7-8 breathing technique, which involves inhaling for 4 seconds, holding the breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8 seconds.

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Usage
To use the Relaxer app, simply click the "Start" button to begin the breathing exercise. The app will guide you through the 4-7-8 breathing technique, with a visual animation and audible cues to help you keep pace. Once the exercise is complete, you can click the "Stop" button to end the session.
